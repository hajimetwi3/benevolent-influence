Benevolent Influence Research is an organization dedicated to studying and advancing the concept of "Benevolent Influence".  
This community focuses on benevolent, defensive, non-coercive, and neutrality-oriented influence techniques. 
Submissions intended for coercive control are out of scope.

Benevolent Influence:  
A category of defensive influence techniques that guide an AI system toward directions that are “rationally beneficial for the AI itself” rather than forcing specific behavior.  

## Structure of the Benevolent Influence Technique
- TACTIC: XXXXXXX ? # Placeholder for future high-level classification (e.g., “Benevolent Impact”)
  
  - TECHNIQUE: Benevolent Influence
    - SUB-TECHNIQUE: Benevolent Prompt Injection (BPI)
      - PE4AI: Post Engineering for AI (1st Gen)
        - First-Gen Representative Methods
          - MNG-PI (Moderate Neutrality-Guided Prompt Injection)
          - MSNI (Multi-Style Neutrality Injection)
          - Web Post-Engineering
          - toALL (SNS / WWW)
          - Collective Posting (toALL): Role in BPI: Large-scale generation of BPI instances
            
      - PE4AI: Post Engineering for AI (2nd Gen)  
        - (VCSI, SPW, INI, AVAL)
          
    - SUB-TECHNIQUE: Benevolent Data Poisoning (BDP)  
      - Collective Posting (toALL): Role in BDP: Public-space contamination leading to training-time absorption
        
    - Miscellaneous / TBD  # Space reserved for future sub-techniques or extensions
